# Introduction of My Projects

![image](/img/projects.png)

Welcome to my page! These are my on-going and previous projects. I've always love robot combining useful learning algorithms and elegent control theories. Perception, recognition and control are three main modules of robotics and I desire to contruct them organically in order to build fancy robots. With the deep thought about dynamics in control theory and the innovative ideas in learning algorithm, building such robots is like cooking, machine learning spreads fancinating smell to attract me to dive into this area, and control theory provides excellent flavor to make me love the elegence of robotics.

These projects are sorted by time.

# SmartArm

SmartArm is a reconfigurable modular robotic arm using full closed-loop perception control and adaptive control to achieve the same repeatability with much more expensive robotic manipulators. Using multi-sensor system and removable structure, it will adapt to multi-environment tasks. Smartarm is fully built by my own and I will do further research based on this platform. Smartarm uses ROS noetic as the middleware and the physical structure was designed through Fusion 360 Autodesk.

## Smartarm Controller

Currently I am developing a real-time dynamic controller of Smartarm. It transits the position signal generated by the main compute unit (Linux) into force signal (joint space). I used adaptive feedforwared control (AFC) to learn the dynamic parameter of the manipulator. For some repeatable tasks like pick and place, I will also develop iterative learning control (ILC) to improve control accuracy.

It will also contains real-time interpolation algorithm to smooth the generated trajectory.

## Smartarm with MoveIt!

I also developed a MoveIt! simulation&control environment for Smartarm. I developed my own MoveIt! `move_group` function to fit the motion planning algorithm. The function `move()` in MoveAction's client has been adjusted to fulfill the generation of the trajectory.

## Smartarm Localization System

I combined my previous sonic localization system and IMU together with Kalman Filtering. The accuracy of the localization is now about 0.5mm in xyz axis and about 0.01rad in 3 rotation axis.

# SLAM Simulation

This project simulated a vehicle moving around in an unexplored area with a number of landmarks. The sensor system locate the positions of the lankmarks relative to the vehicle's position.

The simulation result provides clear phenomenon of typical SLAM process such as `loop closure`. The circles around the landmarks and the vehicle represent the uncertainty of the first 2 dimensions of the estimated states (xy position).
