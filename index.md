# Introduction of My Projects

![image](/img/projects.png)

Welcome to my page! These are my on-going and previous projects. I've always love robot combining useful learning algorithms and elegent control theories. Perception, recognition and control are three main modules of robotics and I desire to contruct them organically in order to build fancy robots. With the deep thought about dynamics in control theory and the innovative ideas in learning algorithm, building such robots is like cooking, machine learning spreads fancinating smell to attract me to dive into this area, and control theory provides excellent flavor to make me love the elegence of robotics.

These projects are sorted by time.

# SmartArm

SmartArm is a series of reconfigurable modular robotic manipulators using full closed-loop perception control and adaptive control to achieve the same repeatability with much more expensive robotic manipulators. Using multi-sensor system and removable structure, it will adapt to multi-environment tasks. Smartarm is fully built by my own and I will do further research based on this platform. Smartarm uses ROS noetic as the middleware and the physical structure was designed through Fusion 360 Autodesk.

The first GIF below shows the reaction speed test of `end effector tracking` with Smartarm's sonic localization system, which is illustrated in the next sector. The second GIF below shows Smartarm's `motion planning & execute` pipeline using `MoveIt!` APIs with my own code adjustments. I also created a `MoveIt!` function called `asyncPlanAndMove()` after changing `MoveIt!` source code to reach my planning goal.

With the benefit of popular open-source frame, Smartarm is suitable for academic and industrial use. I will keep developing this series of robotic manipulators.

## Smartarm Localization System

I combined my previous sonic localization system (developed when I was in Harbin Institute of Technology) and IMU together with `extended Kalman Filtering`. The accuracy of the localization is now about 0.5mm in xyz axis and about 0.01rad in 3 rotation axis.

![image](/img/sonic_array.png)

This sensor system uses `STM32F103RCT6` as the control unit. I developed `DMA(direct memory access)` and `hardware boosting` to calculate the sensors' data faster. The sampling rate is 1000Hz.

## Smartarm Controller

Currently I am developing a real-time dynamic controller of Smartarm. It transits the position signal generated by the main compute unit (Linux) into force signal (joint space). I used adaptive feedforwared control (AFC) to learn the dynamic parameter of the manipulator. For some repeatable tasks like pick and place, I will also develop iterative learning control (ILC) to improve control accuracy.

It will also contains real-time interpolation algorithm to smooth the generated trajectory.

## Smartarm with MoveIt!

I also developed a MoveIt! simulation&control environment for Smartarm. I developed my own MoveIt! `move_group` function to fit the motion planning algorithm. The function `move()` in MoveAction's client has been adjusted as `smartarm_move` to fulfill the fast generation of the trajectory.

The structure above shows Smartarm's MoveIt! functions w.r.t. sensor system and the main control loop. I will continue to develop the low-level real-time controller to improve the performance of Smartarm.

# SLAM Simulation

This project simulated a vehicle moving around in an unexplored area with a number of landmarks. The sensor system locate the positions of the lankmarks relative to the vehicle's position.

The simulation result provides clear phenomenon of typical SLAM process such as `loop closure`. The circles around the landmarks and the vehicle represent the uncertainty of the first 2 dimensions of the estimated states (xy position).

# Sonic Localization System

I developed this localization system during my exchange experience in Harbin Institute of Technology. This localization system contains ultrasonic sensors. Using DMA(direct memry access), the sampling rate had been optimized from 10 Hz to 1000Hz.

# SLAM mobile platform

When I was in Fudan university, I was the host and also the lecturer of every year's National Youth University Science Camp. In 2019's Science Camp, I developed a ROS mobile platform with `Raspberry Pi 3B` as the main controller. The vehicle used lidar as the input and used ROS `gmapping` package for SLAM algorithm.

![image](/img/mobile_platform2.jpg)

In the lecture called `Basic robotics: from theory to practice`, I used this as the tutorial platform and train 100 students the basic SLAM implementing and ROS programming.

It was an interesting experience with all the students from high school who brought much curiosity to the workshop. Hope them dive into the fantastic robot world!

# UAV Interceptor

This is the product of Denghui Project in Fudan University. This low-cost, high speed Micro-UAV interceptor has an available distance about 500m. Within this distance, it can catch most of quadrotors in the market. The aerocraft structure is developed by my own.

![image](/img/uav1.png)

This project spent me a lot of time learning extensive multi-disciplinary knowledge, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer vision, aero-dynamics and embedded programming. I truely learned a lot from the project!

## Anti-UAV Design

During the design procedure, I iterated the aerocraft structure design many times in order to fit the requirements of limited space, material strength, strike distance, low-weight and other practical requirements. The most significant problem is the extremely compact space. I developed a innovative structure to make the system functional in a very limited space (the diameter of the missile-like aerocraft is only 40mm).

![image](/img/uav2.png)

As is illustrated above, the missile-like aerocraft's structure uses a net to catch the UAV. The user launch the missile-like aerocraft through a pneumatic gun. When the 'missile' is closed to the UAV, it will ues high-pressure gas cylinder to spray out a net. The UAV will be unfunctional as log as the net is twisted into the propeller.

In the project's design, there were 3 main aspects to ensure the 'missile' have a strike distance around 500m: pattern recognition, structural design and dynamic analysis. In pattern recognition I used CNN(convolutional neural network) to track the UAV's relative position to the 'missile'. In dynamic analysis, I analysed the elastic displacement using finite element analysis and improve the structure design (I like Mechanical Engineering too!)

![image](/img/uav3.png)

Within all these multi-disciplinary design, I realized that the engineering problem is full of balance and compromise. There will be no excellent product unless we combine multi-disciplinary critical thinking and practice.

I used 3d printer to verify the rationality of the structure.

## UAV Interceptor Experiments

I launched this tiny 'missile' in Fudan campus and the passersby were frightened in a way or another :P. I flied a target quadrotor and the 'missile' brought me back the poor quadrotor, only with many pieces.

# 3Arobot

3Arobot is a series of robotic manipulators printed by the 3D printers. These manipulators have competitive accuracies and repeatabilities. They have the ability to write and draw on a paper with certain end effectors. Furthermore, with a heating extruder, they can be used as 3D printers.

These manipulators brought me the first feasible concepts of robotics, after that I was able to dive into this charming subject. May the force be with robotics.
