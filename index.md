## My Previous Projects

Welcome to my page! These are my on-going and previous projects. For the source code just check the link: [Zu's GitHub](https://github.com/zuxinrui/) to view further descriptions. This page is still under construction. I hope each time I build a new robot (such like high-precision light-weight robotic arm) can be useful for you!

These projects are sorted by time.

### SmartArm

SmartArm is a reconfigurable modular robotic arm using high-performance servo modules to construct variable degrees of freedom. Using CAN protocol and removable structure, it will adapt to multi-environment tasks. The physical structure was designed through Fusion 360 Autodesk.
